## This is a mixin / role

The `with_namer` is simply a mixin class that gives a function a `namer` 
attribute. We could probably abstract this to a `mixin` package. A mixin:

- Adds a class to the value 



## Smarter Defaults from Pipes

This does not work:

 ```R
  library(na.tools)
  f <- . %>% na_omit %>% median 
  f2 <- set_namer(f)
  "foo" %>% name_it(f2)  # "foo.na_omit" 
  
```

It gives the name `foo.na.omit` but should be smart enough to provide 
`foo.median` or `foo.na_omit.median`. A solution may be to have the name taken 
from each function in the pipe:

- `na.omit` would not provide a `namer` function so it is passed through identically
- `median` would add suffix ".median" 

This would:

    "foo" %>% identity %>% name_it("median") 

This would extract the names from the pipe   
```r
lapply( functions(f), . %>% body %>% extract2(1) ) %>% unlist %>% as.character() %>% paste( collapse=".")
```

There might even be verbose mode in which `na_omit` would not be used if omitted
